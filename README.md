# Guppy Screen for Klipper

Guppy Screen is a touch UI for Klipper using APIs exposed by Moonraker. It builds on LVGL as a standalone executable, has no dependency on any display servers such as X/Wayland.

## Roadmap
UI is still in early development. It currently only has been tested with Creality K1/MAX and its touch screen. Code should be fully cross-platform in terms of printer support as well as SoC support (ARM/MIPS/x86/etc).
